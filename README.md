This is an application for the popular board game called battleship. The game 
includes one user playing the game against a computer. The computer is of 
hard difficulty as the only time it misses is when it doesn't hit it after 
firing in a random spot. This program has been made for easy advancement to it 
whether it is adding different levels of computer play, more/less ships, and quickly
adding a second player to play against

Requirements:
Code is written in Java

How to run:
1. A random board will be generated for the user and the computer
2. There are 4, 2 sized ships, 3, 3 sized ships, 2, 4 sized ships, and 1, 5 sized ship
3. The user goes first and picks a col (0 - 9) and a row (0 - 9)
4. If the shot hits a ship on the computer board, then they will go again until they miss
5. The computer then takes their shot and continues until a miss occurs
6. The game ends once either board has no ships remaining (by repeating steps 3-5)
